# Compute Transitive and Transitive and Reflexive Closure of a Relation

## How It Works

This program takes an input representing a relation on a given alphabet from a file and computes the transitive and transitive and reflexive closure of the relation.

## Relation File Rules

```
E T F ( ) a # characters of the alphabet
3 # number of pairs in relation
E T # pair 1
T F # pair 2
F a # pair 3...
```

Execution:
```
python3 main.py <relation_file>
python3 main.py input.txt
```
